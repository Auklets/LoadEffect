## Description
Load Effect is a load testing API that allow you to write a custom script using the API-provided scripting language to simulate real user interactions up to scale.

Load Effect features script validation, domain validation through DNS TXT records and real-time analytics during load tests.

This application was built using React, Redux, Chartist.js, Node.js, express.js, sockets.io, MySQL, Zombie.js, docker, AWS, Digital Ocean, Travis CI, and Mocha/Chai.

## Website Validation

#### DNS Instructions
In order to prevent using the API to perform DDOS attacks, you'll need to verify domain ownership through the use of DNS Text Records.


1. Copy the validation token. It should start with "LoadEffect-""
1. Log in to your domain, access your DNS settings, and look for an option to Add a New Record.
1. Under the field Name/Host/Alias, enter '@'.
1. Under Value/Answer/Destination, paste the validation token and save.

Here's an example of what it would look like for Namecheap:

Depending on your domain provider, it may take from 1 minute to a few days for the DNS Text record to provision. Once provisioned, click on the Unverified dropdown button and select Validate Your Site to run the validation check.

If the validation was successful, the button will turn green and you'll be able to run the test.

#### How The DNS Verification Works

Node has a DNS module built in, which has a number of helpful API's that can perform this lookup on the backend.

Example usage:

```javascript
const dns = require('dns');
const app = require('express')();

const validateWebsite = (request, response) => {
  dns.resolveTxt('anhtaihuynh.com', (err, results) => {
    if (err) {
      response.send(err);
      throw err;
    }
    response.send(results); // Results is a 2D array of the DNS Text record values for the input url
  });
}

app.get('/api/validate-site', validateWebsite);

```
